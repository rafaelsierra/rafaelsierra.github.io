Interests
=========

I am interested in everything related to open source development, I enjoy
writing and consuming webservices, as well as creating useful tools that helps
with my daily tasks.

After learning Docker I started reading and playing with Go and Rust.

Technical Skills
================

Python
------

  Most of my experience as developer comes from creating all sorts of services
  and tools in Python (2 and 3), from simple HTTP servers to multi
  interconnected microservices with asynchronous calls and tasks (via Celery)

Django
------
  I have vast experience with Django as I have been using it since version
  `0.97`, I am comfortable with its whole stack, including writing custom
  middlewares, authentication backends and model managers and queryset.

  `Django Rest Framework <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`_ is one of the
  tools I have used extensively to create RESTful APIs inside Django.

Docker
------
  I have good experience creating and running Docker containers and images from
  scratch (not `FROM SCRATCH <https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch/>`_), using
  multi-staged builds to improve image size whenever possible.
